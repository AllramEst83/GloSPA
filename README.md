# GloSPA

**Glorified Single Page Application**

GloSPA is a lightweight Single Page Application (SPA) framework created as a refreshing alternative to the overly complicated modern frontend frameworks. Sometimes simplicity is the best solution.

## What is GloSPA?

GloSPA stands for "Glorified Single Page Application" - which is my way of saying that modern frontend frameworks have become way too complicated. Instead of wrestling with complex build tools, intricate state management, and endless configuration files, GloSPA provides a straightforward approach to building SPAs.

## Philosophy

Modern web development has become unnecessarily complex. GloSPA embraces simplicity by:

- **No Build Process**: Works directly in the browser without compilation steps
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight and focused on core functionality
- **Easy to Understand**: Clear, readable code that doesn't require extensive documentation to comprehend
- **Quick Setup**: Get started immediately without complicated project scaffolding

## Features

- Component-based architecture
- Client-side routing
- Reactive data binding
- Lightweight and fast
- No external dependencies
- Works with vanilla JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start building your application

That's it! No npm install, no webpack configuration, no babel setup - just open and code.

## Project Structure

```
GloSPA/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── site.css    # Styling
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── site.js     # Main application logic
│   └── provider/
│       └── gloSpa.js   # Core framework code
├── components/         # Reusable components
│   ├── Counter.js
│   └── UserCard.js
└── pages/             # Page components
    ├── AboutPage.js
    └── HomePage.js
```

## Why GloSPA?

Because sometimes you just want to build something without dealing with:
- Complex build pipelines
- Package.json dependency hell
- Framework-specific syntax and patterns
- Hours of configuration before writing your first line of actual code

GloSPA lets you focus on what matters: building your application.
